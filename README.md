# SSL-Expiry-Checker
A one page PHP (+ config) script to check your SSL certificates.

This was inspired by https://github.com/PalFed/SSL-Expiry-Checker

I added the ability to sort by the days left and to query a non standard ssl port eg www.foo.com:8080

# Installation
Put on your webserver, edit the `sslChecker.ini.php`, modify to suit your needs and view.
